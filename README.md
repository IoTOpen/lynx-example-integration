# lynx-example-integration
Example integration for exporting data from the Lynx platform using the [go-lynx](https://github.com/IoTOpen/go-lynx, "go-lynx") library.

This integration exports data from functions created by [Lynx-example-manager](https://github.com/IoTOpen/lynx-example-manager "Lynx-example-manager")
and will not work without the proper devices and functions that it sets up.

### Configure

* Login to Lynx AAM
    * Create a new installation
    * Generate new API key
* Create a new configuration file based on the config-example and name it ```lynx-integration.yml```
